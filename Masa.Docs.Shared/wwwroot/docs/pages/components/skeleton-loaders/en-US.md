# Skeleton loaders

The `MSkeletonLoader` component is a versatile tool that can fill many roles within a project. At its heart, the
component provides an indication to the user that something is coming but not yet available. There are over 30
pre-defined options available that can be combined to make custom examples.

## Usage

The `Vertical` property allows you to stack the contents of **MSnackbar**.

## API

- [MSkeletonLoader](/api/MSkeletonLoader)

## Examples

### Props

#### Boilerplate component

The MSkeletonLoader can be used as boilerplate designs when creating mockups. Mix and match various pre-defined options or create your own unique implementations. In this example, we use a custom data property to apply the same props to multiple MSkeletonLoader's at once.
